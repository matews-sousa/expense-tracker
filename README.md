# Finances App

This is a Ruby on Rails web application for managing transactions. Users can register their transactions with categories such as income and expenses, and view statistics about them.

## 🚀 Features

- User authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their transactions.
- Transaction management: Users can register their transactions with categories such as income, expenses, savings, and investments.
- Dashboard: Users can view statistics about their transactions, including total income, total expenses, and net worth.
- Categories management: Users can manage their transaction categories, including adding, updating, and deleting them.

## 🛠️ Getting started

To run this application locally, you'll need to have Ruby 3.2, Rails 7 and Node v18.15.0. Once you have those set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/matews-sousa/expense-tracker.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd transaction-management-app`
3. Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Set up the database: `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`
5. Start the server: `bin/dev`

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000/. If you make changes to the JavaScript code, Tailwind classes or the Rails application, the server will automatically reload. 

## 🌎 Deployment

This application can be deployed to any cloud platform that supports Ruby on Rails applications. We recommend using [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), a modern platform for deploying and scaling applications.
