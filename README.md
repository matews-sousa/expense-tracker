This is a Ruby on Rails web application for managing transactions. Users can register their transactions with categories such as income and expenses, and view statistics about them.

You can use the application at https://finances-expense-tracker.fly.dev

## 🚀 Features

- User authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their transactions.
- Transaction management: Users can register their transactions with categories such as income, expenses, savings, and investments.
- Dashboard: Users can view statistics about their transactions, including total income, total expenses, and net worth.
- Categories management: Users can manage their transaction categories, including adding, updating, and deleting them.

## 🛠️ Getting started

To run this application locally, you'll need to have Ruby 3.2, Rails 7 and Node v18.15.0. Once you have those set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/matews-sousa/expense-tracker.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd transaction-management-app`
3. Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Set up the database: `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`
5. Start the server: `bin/dev`

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000/. If you make changes to the JavaScript code, Tailwind classes or the Rails application, the server will automatically reload. 

## 🌎 Deployment

This application can be deployed to any cloud platform that supports Ruby on Rails applications. We recommend using [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), a modern platform for deploying and scaling applications.
